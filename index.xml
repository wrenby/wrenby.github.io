      <description>Hi! My name is Wren, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Pittsburgh-native amateur astrophotographer. Nights of Wren is a personal site I&amp;rsquo;m creating as a platform to share my photos with others. My work to date is mostly deep-sky astrophotography, which means almost all of my targets are very distant things as opposed to planets. This category includes a wide variety of object types: ancient clusters of stars in orbit around the Milky Way, oceans of star-forming hydrogen lightyears across, remnants of dead or dying stars, galaxies far far away, and more.</description>

      <title>M 31, The Andromeda Galaxy</title>

      <description>The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as M 31 and NGC 224, formerly the Great Spiral Nebula in Andromeda) is our closest neighboring galaxy of similar size at approximately 245 million lightyears in the direction of the constellation Andromeda, and is projected to merge with the Milky Way in 4-5 billion years. The Andromeda Galaxy played an important role in The Great Debate concerning the size of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies &amp;ndash; then called spiral nebulae or island universes, depending on your side of the argument.</description>

      <title>M 27, The Dumbbell Nebula</title>

      <description>The Dumbbell Nebula (also known as M 27, NGC 6853, PK 060-03.1, and The Apple Core Nebula) is a vibrant funeral display of a star estimated to have died around 10,000 years ago. What remains is a white dwarf, surrounded by a glowing cloud of gas that made up its outer layers as a red giant. The Dumbbell Nebula was discovered in 1764, and was the first of its kind to be found.</description>

      <title>C 33, The Eastern Veil Nebula</title>

      <description>The Eastern Veil Nebula (also known as C 33, NGC 6992, and Ced 182b) is part of a large emissive supernova remnant called the Cygnus Loop. The Cygnus Loop in its entirety is estimated be around 10 to 20 thousand years old, 2670 lightyears away from Earth, and 120 lightyears across. The Eastern Veil is a portion of this larger nebula that emits relatively bright light in visible wavelengths due to high concentrations of oxygen, sulphur, and hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Total Lunar Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://astro.wren.dev/gallery/2022-05-15-lunar-eclipse/</link>

      <description>During a lunar eclipse, the moon appears red due to the way the light interacts with Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. Since the Earth is blocking direct sunlight, the only light it can receive has been refracted through the atmosphere, and the photons most likely to survive the trip are those with longer wavelengths: red light. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh Scattering, and it&amp;rsquo;s also responsible for the color of sunsets and the sky during the day.</description>

      <title>IC 5067, The Pelican Nebula</title>
      <link>https://astro.wren.dev/gallery/2022-05-10-ic5067-pelican-neb/</link>

      <description>The smaller next-door neighbor of the North America Nebula, the Pelican Nebula (also known as IC 5067, LBN 353, and Ced 183a) is a hydrogen alpha emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus. Captured using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6&amp;quot; F/4 mounted on a Celestron AVX, processed with Siril and GIMP. This image is a stack of 3 hours total integration time distributed over 120 exposures at 1000 ISO, and calibrated with 100 biases, 40 flats, and 40 darks.</description>
