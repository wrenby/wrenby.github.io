[{"categories":null,"contents":"Hi! My name is Wren, and I\u0026rsquo;m a Pittsburgh-native amateur astrophotographer. Nights of Wren is a personal site I\u0026rsquo;m creating as a platform to share my photos with others. My work to date is mostly deep-sky astrophotography, which means almost all of my targets are very distant things as opposed to planets. This category includes a wide variety of object types: ancient clusters of stars in orbit around the Milky Way, oceans of star-forming hydrogen lightyears across, remnants of dead or dying stars, galaxies far far away, and more.","date":"2022-07-30T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://astro.wren.dev/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The Eastern Veil Nebula (also known as C 33, NGC 6992, and Ced 182b) is part of a large emissive supernova remnant called the Cygnus Loop. The Cygnus Loop in its entirety is estimated be around 10 to 20 thousand years old, 2670 lightyears away from Earth, and 120 lightyears across. The Eastern Veil is a portion of this larger nebula that emits relatively bright light in visible wavelengths due to high concentrations of oxygen, sulphur, and hydrogen.","date":"2022-05-30T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://astro.wren.dev/gallery/2022-05-30-c33-eastern-veil-neb/","tags":["deep-sky","nebula","supernova-remnant","emission-nebula"],"title":"C 33, The Eastern Veil Nebula"},{"categories":null,"contents":"During a lunar eclipse, the moon appears red due to the way the light interacts with Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere. Since the Earth is blocking direct sunlight, the only light it can receive has been refracted through the atmosphere, and the photons most likely to survive the trip are those with longer wavelengths: red light. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh Scattering, and it\u0026rsquo;s also responsible for the color of sunsets and the sky during the day.","date":"2022-05-15T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://astro.wren.dev/gallery/2022-05-15-lunar-eclipse/","tags":["solar-system","moon"],"title":"Total Lunar Eclipse"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The smaller next-door neighbor of the North America Nebula, the Pelican Nebula (also known as IC 5067, LBN 353, and Ced 183a) is a hydrogen alpha emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus.
