      <description>My first successful attempt at planetary photography! It&amp;rsquo;s not about to win an APOD, but basically no part of my equipment is well-suited for planetary work except this camera, so I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy with the amount of detail that&amp;rsquo;s visible. Even with through a monochrome camera depriving it of its signature color, being able to clearly make out the Great Red Spot is extremely cool :D
This final image is a sharpened stack of the best 90% of 10,000 frames of video spanning about two minutes.</description>
