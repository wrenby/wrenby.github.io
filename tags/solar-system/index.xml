      <description>My first successful attempt at planetary photography! It&amp;rsquo;s not about to win an APOD, but basically no part of my equipment is well-suited for planetary work except this camera, so I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy with the amount of detail that&amp;rsquo;s visible. Even with through a monochrome camera depriving it of its signature color, being able to clearly make out the Great Red Spot is extremely cool :D
This final image is a sharpened stack of the best 90% of 10,000 frames of video spanning about two minutes.</description>

      <title>Total Lunar Eclipse</title>

      <description>During a lunar eclipse, the moon appears red due to the way the light interacts with Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. Since the Earth is blocking direct sunlight, the only light it can receive has been refracted through the atmosphere, and the photons most likely to survive the trip are those with longer wavelengths: red light. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh Scattering, and it&amp;rsquo;s also responsible for the color of sunsets and the sky during the day.</description>
